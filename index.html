            <p>Hey! Glad you’re here, looks like you found my personal website.
                The purpose of this page is to provide a bit of information about me, my background
                in programming, as well as share my portfolio. Right now, my portfolio
                is quite small considering I am just now creating projects to share with everyone.
                Right, well to start I am currently enrolled at Messiah University. This is my first
                year on campus, but technically I am a sophomore. It’s a little complicated but check
                out the Education section if you want to know more. I am 18 years old, and I currently
                live in Maryland with my parents and 2 siblings. I have one brother who is 2 years older
                than me, and a twin sister. Both of my siblings currently attend college online, but my
                sister plans to transfer to a school to live on campus next year. My family and I love animals,
                we currently have one cat as our resident pet, but we volunteer with a local organization to train
                service dogs. If you wanna hear about some of my other hobbies, check out the Hobbies section.</p>

        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>My hobbies span a broad range of interests. Most exciting to me is programming,
                which I have been actively pursuing for nearly a decade. I started learning on
                Khan Academy at 11 years old, where I would create animations and games using a
                JavaScript framework. I then went on to teach myself Java, which is now my main language.
                I have since dabbled in various other languages, but I find Java most natural to me.
                I also really enjoy playing and watching sports. I will play almost any sport,
                even though I may not be very good, and I really enjoy watching football.
                My favorite sport to watch is Formula 1, because it is something I grew up watching with my family.
                In high school, I golfed and swam competitively, and although I no longer compete,
                I still enjoy practicing. I also really enjoy listening to and playing music.
                My favorite bands right now are the Arctic Monkeys, Twenty One Pilots, and The Black Keys.
                I played trombone in a band from 8-18, and I played trumpet in a jazz band for the last 2 years
                of high school. </p>
