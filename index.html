                Hey! Glad you’re here, looks like you found my personal website.
                The purpose of this page is to provide a bit of information about me, my background
                in programming, as well as share my portfolio. Right now, my portfolio
                is quite small considering I am just now creating projects to share with everyone.
                Right, well to start I am currently enrolled at Messiah University. This is my first
                year on campus, but technically I am a sophomore. It’s a little complicated but check
                out the Education section if you want to know more. I am 18 years old, and I currently
                live in Maryland with my parents and 2 siblings. I have one brother who is 2 years older
                than me, and a twin sister. Both of my siblings currently attend college online, but my
                sister plans to transfer to a school to live on campus next year. My family and I love animals,
                we currently have one cat as our resident pet, but we volunteer with a local organization to train
                service dogs. If you wanna hear about some of my other hobbies, check out the Hobbies section.

        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>My hobbies span a broad range of interests. Most exciting to me is programming,
                which I have been actively pursuing for nearly a decade. I started learning on
                Khan Academy at 11 years old, where I would create animations and games using a
                JavaScript framework. I then went on to teach myself Java, which is now my main language.
                I have since dabbled in various other languages, but I find Java most natural to me.
                I also really enjoy playing and watching sports. I will play almost any sport,
                even though I may not be very good, and I really enjoy watching football.
                My favorite sport to watch is Formula 1, because it is something I grew up watching with my family.
                In high school, I golfed and swam competitively, and although I no longer compete,
                I still enjoy practicing. I also really enjoy listening to and playing music.
                My favorite bands right now are the Arctic Monkeys, Twenty One Pilots, and The Black Keys.
                I played trombone in a band from 8-18, and I played trumpet in a jazz band for the last 2 years
                of high school. </p>

    <div class="card" id="education">
        <h1>Education</h1>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>As I mentioned briefly in the About Me, I am currently enrolled as a sophomore at Messiah University.
                I am currently majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development,
                and minoring in Spanish. Until enrolling in university, I had been homeschooled for all of elementary,
                middle, and high school. I participated in many extracurricular events at other events,
                such as band at a school nearby. After discovering my passion for computer programming,
                I asked my mom to incorporate programming classes in my schedule during high school.
                Being homeschooled was a great benefit to me during this time, because I got to choose exactly what
                classes I wanted to take so my courses were always interesting. In freshman year of 9th grade I took
                AP Computer Science Principles, and in 10th grade I took AP Computer Science A(programming in Java).
                I received 5s on both exams, which allowed me to get a jump start on the courses required for my major. <br><br>

                Again in 12th grade, homeschooling proved to be an advantage once again. I was able to complete
                6 courses dual-enrolled at Messiah University as well as a community college. This helped me even
                further with my college studies because I had completed 30 credits of college classes before
                graduating from high school. I am currently set to graduate in 3 years, with the class of 2024.
                As for my minor in Spanish, which I have not really discussed much, I plan to study abroad soon
                to complete the required amount of credits. I took Spanish courses in high school, like many other students.
                During this time, I also began working in a job with many hispanic coworkers. I found that I was able
                to use what I was learning, and this sparked a passion in me, to pursue Spanish as a degree.
                I have already completed all of my required language courses, and all that is left are culture
                courses which I will complete at the University of Granada, Spain, during my time abroad.</p>

    I'm currently working on a nice photo gallery that will allow users to scroll through a set of photos,
    or automatically progress through if no input is given. I was unable to successfully implement this in time,
    unfortunately, but I am researching different ways to do this currently.
